# Turtle Simulating Robot 
### Brandon Choe, Calder Birdsey - December 2019 
## Introduction 
### Goal
- Create a physical turtle-simulating robot leveraging ES coding concepts and hands-on hardware assembly, as we have done throughout the semester
- Create a project that shows, in the physical world, the flow of digital control

### Motivation 
- Most CS students at Middlebury work with turtle in CSCI 101 or CSCI 150. Since we are graduating soon, we wanted to tie-back one of our final electives to the first class many of us took.

## Methods 
- Devices and Peripherals 
- Code Logic 
- User Interface
- Bill of Materials
